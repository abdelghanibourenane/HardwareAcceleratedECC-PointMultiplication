# HardwareAcceleratedECC-PointMultiplication
This repository contains an accelerated hardware IPs for scalar and double point multiplication operations in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). The IP is designed using high-level synthesis (HLS) and incorporates a novel approach to recode the scalars using Radix-2 Windowing arithmetic.
